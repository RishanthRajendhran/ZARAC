    This is the repository for the research on whether introduction of model uncertainties in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07355"> ZARA </a> would lead to improvements in self-rationalizing capability of LLMs, done with Professor Ana Marasovic at The University of Utah.

<p>
    Due to time and budget constraints, this work was shelved after managing to replicate ZARA results with our code.
